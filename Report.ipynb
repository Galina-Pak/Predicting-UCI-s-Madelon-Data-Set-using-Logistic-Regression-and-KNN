    "### Domain and Data\n",
    "This project will be working with UCI's Madelon data set. The data is completely artificial, randomly labeled +1 or -1 with 500 features. Of these 500 features, 20 of them are \"real\" features and the remaining 480 are \"probes\" which add noise to the data. Of the 20 real features, there are 5 informative features, and the remaining 15 are linear combinations of the 5 informative features to add additional noise. The order of the features and patters were randomized."

    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "To predict the labels (1 or -1) of this data set, four models will be built. First, a naive logistic regression (no regularization penalty) will be made as a benchmark for our classification score. Second, a logistic regression model with a l1 norm penalty to regularization for the data set's features. Third, a logistic regression model whose parameters are tuned through grid search and cross-validation. Finally, a K nearest neighbors classifier with parameters tuned through grid search and cross-validation will be used in case the data set is non-linear."

    "I will use the standard classification metric, \"accuracy\".  IE, what percentage did the model label the data points correctly. I will Also look at false positives, and AUC as some deeper metrics to further provide some context as I make more complex models. In addition, KNN's accuracy will be calculated through the standard Minkowski Metric. However, the results of the KNN will be comparable to the logistic regression through AUC and confusion matrix analysis."

    "The schematic above shows the methodology for building the benchmark logistic regression model. First I load the data from the data base into a Pandas DataFrame. I then separate the features from the labels (target vector). I then Make a data dictionary, which stores a train-test split of the provided data. This train-test split is important because that means I can train my logistic regression model with the split off training set and then validate my model with the unseen test data set. I then scale the features in both the training and test data set. Finally, I train my logistic regression model on the training set, and predict the labels of the data set on the test set. The benchmark runs a \"C\" value of 10000 whereas the \"C\" value of the second logistic regression model is 0.01 using the l1 norm as a penalty."

The benchmark model had a very high training score relative to its test score indicating that the model is over fit, despite the test score being not much better than a coin flip. Adding l1 regularization lowered Logistic Regression's training score significantly, however its test score rose to 0.621! When grid searching over both penalty and C, the strength of regularization, Logistic Regression did not fare much better than when C = 0.01. This indicates that the features in the Madelon data set are very nonlinear, and that there might be some limits to logistic regression on this data set.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the results, Logistic Regression has difficulty predicting labels in this data set with the given features. SelectKbest, when selecting the 10 features, does a good job finding the most important features. Furthermore, KNN did a very good job at predicting the labels, with a 0.895 True Positive rate and a 0.846 True Negative rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, given the data set description, where there are 5 \"informative\" features and the rest are either linear combinations of those features or complete noise, a better job of feature selection could be done in the future. The problem with SelectKBest is that you are guessing \"k\" for the right number of features and hoping that your model takes care of the rest through regularization. A more sophisticated approach, like Recursive Feature Elimination may be able to minimize features while keeping a high prediction score. Since Recursive Feature Elimination allows the modeler to use a sophisticated estimator to select the best features, and order them in level of importance, using a strong non-linear estimator such as a Random Forest Classifier would be a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other models to consider other than KNN might be to just use a Random Forest Classifier to make the classifications (instead of KNN) or a gradient boosted decision tree."
